# Eat-Da-Burger

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* App will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
* This is not in requirement-added a `Delete` button for each devoured burger.Now the user the can delete the devoured burger if they want to.
